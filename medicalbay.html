The medical bay houses several exciting projects.

The milli-spinner is a <em>tiny</em> origami robot. Its special shape – a triangulated hollow cylinder – enables it to swim or move in different ways under magnetic control. It is actually the fastest untethered magnetic robot for navigating tube-shaped environments. The rapid, efficient movement of the milli-spinner allows it to travel through the strong blood flow that characterizes vascular systems to treat conditions like blood clots and brain aneurysms, and to deliver medicine to specific targets in the body in a minimally invasive manner.

In the remote ultrasound project, a robotic arm houses and maneuvers the ultrasound transducer. Since it can record the exact pose of each transducer reading, it can build a 3-D model from the individual 2D images – leading to more natural interpretation of the ultrasound findings. The setup can either be controlled autonomously or it can be controlled remotely by an operator via a haptic interface. In either case, the radiologist can be in a different physical location than the patient. With this model, doctors can care for patients in communities that are too small, remote, or under-resourced to have a full complement of local doctors. At Stanford, we have demonstrated using this setup to do a remote ultrasound 6,800 miles away in Chengdu, China.

Finally, we are showcasing here a DaVinci surgical system, donated by Intuitive Surgical. This is probably the most well known robot surgical system that is in active use at hospitals, including at Stanford. Having our own DaVinci system in the robotics center means that students can take it apart, change motors, experiment with its haptic control, try out innovative ideas like adding an autonomous third arm to the setup, and generally think about the design of the next generation of robotic surgical systems.
