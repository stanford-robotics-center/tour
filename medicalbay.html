The medical bay houses several exciting projects.

The milli-spinner is a tiny robot with a special shape that enables it to swim under magnetic control. With its rapid, efficient movement, the milli-spinner can travel through the vascular system to treat conditions like blood clots, and it can deliver medicine to specific targets in the body.

In the remote ultrasound project, a robotic arm is in charge of the ultrasound probe. By recording the exact pose of each probe reading, the system can build 3-D models from the individual 2-D images. Furthermore, the robot arm can be controlled remotely by an operator via a haptic interface. At Stanford, we have demonstrated using this setup to do a remote ultrasound 6,800 miles away in Chengdu, China.

Finally, we are showcasing here a DaVinci surgical system, donated by Intuitive Surgical. Having our own DaVinci system in the robotics center means that students can try out innovative ideas like adding an autonomous third arm to the setup, and generally think about the design of the next generation of robotic surgical systems.
