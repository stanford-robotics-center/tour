<p>Welcome to the Stanford Robotics Center, which brings together three dozen cross disciplinary Stanford researchers and also key industrial affiliates. The unique collaborative facility we have at the SRC supports large-scale innovative projects for transformative impact on people and the planet.

On this self-guided audio tour, you will visit the different bays in the SRC and hear about the research showcased in each of them. You can go more in-depth on the tour by using the QR codes you encounter or by clicking the button for the SRC chatbot at the bottom of the screen. The chatbot has access to a knowledge base about SRC projects, so you can ask questions (using your earbuds with built-in microphone) like “What is soft robotics?” or “What are toddler bots?”.
