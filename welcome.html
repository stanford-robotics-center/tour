Welcome to the Stanford Robotics Center, which brings together three dozen cross disciplinary world-class Stanford researchers and also key industrial affiliates. The unique collaborative facility we have here supports large-scale innovative projects for transformative impact on people and the planet.

In this self-guided audio tour, you can go to any of the destinations you see listed on this page, and click on the relevant link to hear about the research that is highlighted there. We suggest visiting the locations in the order they are listed, but you can vary your path if you’d like. As you look around, note that you'll see some QR codes displayed in the SRC space that you can use to learn more about some of the projects we've done here.

For this audio tour, it’s best to use earbuds with a built-in microphone so that we keep the SRC at a quiet volume, and so that the SRC chatbot can hear you well. You are welcome to ask questions by clicking the button for the SRC chatbot at the bottom of the screen. It has access to a knowledge base of documents about the projects you'll see on the tour. Feel free to ask your questions in the language of your choice; it's also ok to interrupt the chatbot.

Note that the audio tour will stop playing if you ask a question mid-description, but it will pick up from where you left off if you click the “Play” button.
