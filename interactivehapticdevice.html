This is an interactive demo that you are welcome to try for yourself -- just be gentle, please! As you use this haptic device made by Force Dimension, you will be interacting with the simulations that you see on the screen and you will experience what we mean by haptic feedback -- a technology that lets a system transmit information to the user through the sense of touch. These high-precision force-feedback devices simulate the curvature, stiffness, and texture of materials, allowing you to interact with digital environments as if they were real.
