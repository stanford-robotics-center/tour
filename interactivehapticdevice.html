At this stop, we have an interactive demo that you are welcome to try for yourself â€“ just be gentle, please!

The device you will use here provides "force feedback"; this allows you to feel at a physical level that the digital environments you are exploring are real.

To try it out, simply grasp the black cylinder handle and use it like a joystick. To switch to a different demo, put your thumb and forefinger in the loops, then squeeze gently.
