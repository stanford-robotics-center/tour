  <p>The SRC chatbot has access to a knowledge base of academic articles about Stanford robotics research, so you can ask questions like <em>"What is soft robotics?”</em> or  <em>“What are toddler bots?”</em>. You can interact with the chatbot either via audio or via text. If you choose to use audio, it's best to use earbuds with with a built-in microphone so that the SRC chatbot hears only you, and is not distracted by other conversation or sounds. Note that the chatbot can understand a wide variety of languages, so you're welcome to ask your questions in the language of your choice. You can also interrupt the chatbot at any time.
