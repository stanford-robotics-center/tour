The Domestic Suite focuses on robotic systems that assist with everyday life. Just about everyone welcomes help with tasks like household cleanup or bed making, but for some senior citizens -- and also people with disabilities -- robotic assistive technology at home promises to be essential for independent living.

One of the robots featured here is TidyBot, a mobile manipulator that can pick up objects and put them away. TidyBot leverages language-based planning and perception combined with large language models to learn user preferences from a small number of examples. In the video, you can see TidyBot picking up laundry from the floor, recognizing if the laundry item is light or dark, and then placing it in the proper hamper. TidyBot can put a hat away in the correct drawer, and it can also pick up toys. Throwing the ball into the toy bin adds some fun to this demo! Itâ€™s TidyBot's use of AI that lets it place objects correctly even in unfamiliar scenarios.

You can also see two TidyBots working together to make a bed. Handling the flexible bedcover is an impressive robotic feat.

In addition to household tidying, the video shows a demonstration of a robotic arm that utilizes AI to provide feeding assistance. This system is designed for individuals with mobility limitations, helping them maintain independence by accurately delivering food in a way that aligns with their preferences and needs.
