The fully-functional Kitchen space is used to explore how robots can assist with food preparation, cleaning and serving. It is also the home to our weekly robotics happy hours, where the larger Stanford Robotics community comes together.

The videos you see showcase three different demos that were part of our launch in fall 2024.

First, ARMAR-7, a humanoid robot from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, can execute complex tasks, like delivering food items in the kitchen. It learns from human demonstrations and its own experience, and it responds to spoken language or gestures.

Second, the MobileAloha robot is a platform for bimanual mobile manipulation with low-cost whole-body teleoperation. It does imitation-learning from human demonstrations. Researchers have found that co-training can increase success rates by up to 90%, allowing MobileAloha to autonomously complete tasks like rinsing a dirty pan using a kitchen faucet, or even sauteing and serving shrimp.

Finally, the UMI (Universal Manipulation Interface) project showcases an innovative data collection and policy learning framework. It employs handheld grippers to enable portable, low-cost, and information-rich data collection, and they like to say this happens “in the wild”. This data is used to learn policies that are hardware-agnostic and deployable across multiple robot platforms. The resulting robot policies zero-shot generalize to novel environments and objects.
