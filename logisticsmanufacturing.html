In this bay, researchers explore how robotics can contribute to increased efficiency and adaptability in logistics and manufacturing. During our launch in fall 2024, we featured demos from some of our industrial affiliates who deal with logistics and manufacturing *at scale*, and we also featured demos from our own research labs that tackle these real world problems.

The current excitement around humanoid robots finds a natural home in this domain. Several of our research groups are interested in humanoid robots and how they can learn motion and autonomous skills from human data. Drawing on the latest machine learning algorithms and data collection strategies, these robots can autonomously perform tasks like walking, handling objects, and interacting with other robots, showcasing real-time adaptability.

Moving our focus from the whole body to the fingertip, the DenseTact project revolves around a small, soft, sensor-equipped gripper with eight degrees of freedom, designed to grasp and manipulate small objects in cluttered environments. The system achieves precise control and a high success rate for tasks like the tactile recognition and subsequent grasping of a small screw from a bowl full of assorted hardware.

Finally, through the glass, you can see a mobile robot platform equipped with an advanced robotic arm for quick, autonomous maintenance in data centers, including fiber optic module replacement. Under haptic control, the robot can perform precise manipulations to handle delicate tasks and swiftly resolve component failures.
