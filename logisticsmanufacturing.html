Like many of our projects at the SRC, the research showcased here spans multiple research groups at Stanford and involves industrial partners. Our Executive Director Steve Cousins often points out that our robotics faculty know what’s possible and that industry knows what’s necessary. When they collaborate on projects and direction, that leads to maximum impact.
