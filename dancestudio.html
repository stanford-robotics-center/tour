The Dance Studio focuses on the study of human motion. The studio is equipped with OptiTrack motion capture systems to track and collect data on human movement patterns, fluidity, balance, and coordination. Researchers can use this data to make robots move more like people do. In addition, the collected information can inform the design of robot control systems that can respond to changes in terrain and external forces.

Also of note, the Stanford Robotics Center supports work on artistic choreorobotics. In the spring of 2025, one of our SRC researchers created a nine-foot tall interactive robotic hand – called Manifold – that has performed with human dancers and gone on display at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.
