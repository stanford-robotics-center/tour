Ocean OneK is a humanoid robot designed for underwater exploration at depths of up to 1,000 (i.e., one K) meters, which is far deeper than a human diver can go. The robot has stereoscopic vision, eight thrusters, bimanual arms, and hands that combine force sensors and haptic feedback. These features allow the human pilot to see what the robot sees and feel what the robot feels.

Professor Oussama Khatib, the faculty director for the Stanford Robotics Center, and the visionary behind the Ocean One robot, likes to say that this is the first ocean robot that can not only “see”, but can also “do”.

In the Ocean Walk, you can see videos highlighting some of the key expeditions so far. Plus, you can take a selfie with Ocean OneK itself!
