Here in the Autodesk Field Robotics Bay, you can see ReachBot, a robotic platform for exploring environments like the caves on Mars. It has arms like measuring tapes that can unfurl to ten feet long. With its three-fingered grippers, the robot can firmly grasp rough rock and pull itself forward — even up steep inclines or on uneven rocky floors.

This bay has also housed the Vinebot, which is a soft, growing, pneumatic robot. It navigates by extending from its base through a movement that is like turning a sock inside out, and it can grow to 100 times its initial size. It’s a great example of soft robotics.

Finally, Firefly is a lightweight automated monocopter drone for rapid scouting and data collection. It can go in a backpack and it has thrust vectoring, autonomous operation, and adaptability. It was originally built for firefighters as a student class project.
