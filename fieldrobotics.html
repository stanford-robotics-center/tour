Through the window of the Autodesk Field Robotics Bay, you can see several of the projects in field robotics, construction, and space robotics that we are highlighting.

On the right hand side, you see a setup that demonstrates how robotics can help with remote maintenance in the field. Here, the job is to clean the insulation from high-voltage power cables, which is inherently dangerous. By using a robotic arm with haptic feedback, a human is still in control but can do the task safely out of harm’s way.

On the left hand side, you can see ReachBot, which is a robotic platform inspired by spiders and engineered for exploring environments like the caves and lava tubes on Mars. ReachBot features arms that can be rigid or rolled up, like a metal measuring tape. At the end of each arm – also known as a boom – is a three-fingered gripper equipped with “microspines” – made from sewing needles – that help the robot firmly grasp rough rock. This innovative design allows the robot to reach out, grasp distant surfaces, and pull itself forward — even up steep inclines, on uneven rocky floors, and within confined spaces.

Behind the ReachBot is space for the Vinebot, which is a soft, growing, pneumatic robot. It navigates by extending from its base like a vine, through a movement that is like turning a sock inside out. It can grow to <b>100 times</b> its initial size. It is soft, lightweight, flexible, and can move through complex environments that would be difficult for a traditional robot to traverse. It’s a great example of soft robotics.

Finally, the back of the room is a place where we’ve flown the Firefly, a lightweight automated monocopter drone for rapid scouting and data collection. Under one and a half pounds, it can go in a backpack and it has thrust vectoring, autonomous operation, and adaptability. It was originally built for firefighters as a student class project. We like to showcase it here as it’s a great example of how the center supports student class projects as well as more advanced academic research.
